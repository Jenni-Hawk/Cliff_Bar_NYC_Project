# Client / Background
This mock project for Cliff Bars was designed to showcase my exploratory data analysis knowledge, technical knowledge, and strength in data storytelling.

With the push in NYC to physically go back to work, Cliff Bar wants to be the top-of-mind brand in NYC associated with giving people the energy they need to get back to normal. 

Product sampling has been planned:
- Street teams will be deployed at MTA Stations
- Cliff Bar samples will be distributed with a coupon to be used at Duane Reade

Key Questions to answer: Where + When 
- What stations have the most traffic? 
- On what days are most people using MTA? â€¨
- Where do Duane Read locations fall within top MTA stations?
	- Are they within walking distance?
- How does the reporting period compare against a pre-Covid timeframe?

Tools Used
Pandas: connect to local database via SQLAlchemy, data manipulation, time series / date functionality
