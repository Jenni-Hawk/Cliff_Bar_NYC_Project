# Cliff_Bar_NYC_Project
#### Cliff Bar NYC Subway Sampling Opportunity Analysis
- This was my first data science project with Metis. 
- The goals of this project are to be immersed in exploratory data analysis, apply technical knowledge, and show my strength in data storytelling. 


# Client / Background
With the push in NYC to physically go back to work, Cliff Bar wants to be the top-of-mind brand in NYC associated with giving people the energy they need to get back to normal. 

#### Product sampling has been planned:
- Street teams will be deployed at MTA Stations
- Cliff Bar samples will be distributed with a coupon to be used at Duane Reade

#### Key Questions to answer: Where + When 
- What stations have the most traffic? 
- On what days are most people using MTA? â€¨
- Where do Duane Read locations fall within top MTA stations?
	- Are they within walking distance?
- How does pre-Covid ridership compare to ridership to ridership in Feb 2022?

# Design
Analyze two different time periods:
#### Opportunity Analysis Window: 1/29/22 - 3/19/22
- Rationale: Look at data when Omicron is at it its lowest level to get the most current ridership behavior to inform upcoming marketing initiatives.

#### Pre-Covid vs emerging Post Covid Analysis Window: Feb 2020 vs Feb 2022 
- Rationale: February 2020 No Covid.  February 2022 Omicron at lowest point. Compare and contrast pre vs post covid behaviors. What does ridership look like in Feb 2022 versus before Covid? 

# Data
Utilized the following data sources: 
- NYC MTA turnstile data http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html 
- NYC MTA Latitude / Longitude: https://data.ny.gov/widgets/i9wp-a4ja 
- Duane Read location data: https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Duane%20Reade%20Pharmacy-USA/  
- CDC Covid Case Tracker: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases 
- CDC Covid Timeline: https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html

# Technical Methodology
Three technical workflows were established:

#### MTA Station Volume + Highest Commuter Days 
- Read in MTA csv data via Pandas and SQLAlchemy	
- Utilized Pandas to manipulate data and Matplotlib to visualize data 
#### Duane Reade locations filtered by top MTA locations	
- Read in Duane Reed location data into Pandas (contains zip code and lat/long data)	
- Removed non-relevant columns to make it simpler to upload to Google Maps for location plotting	
- Filtered Duane Reed data by the zip codes of the top MTA stations	
- Exported .csv that contained lat/long for all Duane Reades within top MTA footprint	
- Uploaded .csv to Google Maps for plotting

#### Pre-Covid vs Post Covid 
- Read in MTA csv data via Pandas and SQLAlchemy 
- Utilized Pandas to manipulate data and Matplotlib to visualize data

# Tools Used
- Pandas: data manipulation, time series / date functionality
- SQLAlchemy: to connect to local database
- Matplotlib: data visualization
