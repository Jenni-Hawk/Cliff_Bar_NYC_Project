# Cliff_Bar_NYC_Project
#### Cliff Bar NYC Subway Sampling Opportunity Analysis
- This was my first data science project with Metis. 
- This mock project for Cliff Bar was designed to showcase my exploratory data analysis knowledge, technical knowledge, and strength in storytelling. 


# Client / Background
With the push in NYC to physically go back to work, Cliff Bar wants to be the top-of-mind brand in NYC associated with giving people the energy they need to get back to normal. 

#### Product sampling has been planned:
- Street teams will be deployed at MTA Stations
- Cliff Bar samples will be distributed with a coupon to be used at Duane Reade

#### Key Questions to answer: Where + When 
- What stations have the most traffic? 
- On what days are most people using MTA? â€¨
- Where do Duane Read locations fall within top MTA stations?
	- Are they within walking distance?
- How does the reporting period compare against a pre-Covid timeframe?

# Design
Analyze two different time periods:
#### Opportunity Analysis Window: 1/29/22 - 3/19/22
- Rationale: Look at data when Omicron is at it its lowest level to get the most current ridership behavior to inform upcoming marketing initiatives.

#### Pre-Covid vs emerging Post Covid Analysis Window: Feb 2020 vs Feb 2022 
Rationale: February 2020 No Covid.  February 2022 Omicron at lowest point.
Compare and contrast pre vs post covid behaviors. What does ridership look like in Feb 2022 versus before Covid? 



# Tools Used
Pandas: connect to local database via SQLAlchemy, data manipulation, time series / date functionality
Matplotlib: data visualization
